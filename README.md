How to Use the Blind 75
Study Regularly: Dedicate time each day to solve problems from the list. Consistency is key.
Understand Concepts: Focus on understanding the underlying concepts and patterns used in each problem.
Practice Coding: Implement solutions in code and test them thoroughly. Practice coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.
Review Solutions: After solving a problem, review and understand the optimal solutions and alternative approaches.
Mock Interviews: Use the problems to conduct mock interviews with peers or use platforms offering mock interview services.
Additional Tips
Focus on Patterns: Many problems share common patterns. Identifying these patterns will help in solving similar problems efficiently.
Time Management: Practice solving problems within a time limit to simulate interview conditions.
Optimize Solutions: Aim to write both correct and efficient code. Understand the time and space complexity of your solutions.
